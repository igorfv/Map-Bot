Map-Bot
========

Autonomous robot for Mapping an area and walking in this area via image recognition!

A personal project :)
For a while the robot will only walk/ride arround randomly not hiting some stuff (ultrasonic distance sensor)

== What I'm going to use?
* Arduino (done)
* A robot base (done)
* IR distance sensor (I hate this ultrasonic sensor)
* RaspberryPI (on the way, i'm just waiting it to arrive)
* Microsoft Kinect (I'm going to use it's sensors to Map an area using some image references)

The main idea is that the robot should be able to map an area and find an way back home :P
